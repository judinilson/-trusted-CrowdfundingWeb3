            <strong>Trusted Crowdfunding</strong> Campaigns will help you turn
            your creative ideas into reality! It's where creators share new
            visions for creative work with the communities that will come
            together to fund them.
          </p>

          <p className={styles.p}>
            Some of these creators already had huge fanbases. But many projects
            have been as small-scale as a limited run of silent meditation
            vinyls or as up-and-coming.
          </p>

          <p className={styles.p}>
            No matter what, creators always control how the work comes
            togetherâ€”no 100-page grant applications, no donors demanding you
            modify your message, no last-minute edits from investors. When
            backers chip in funding and help spread the word, they too become
            part of these independent works.
          </p>
